<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Welcome to my personal portfolio website. As a web dev enthusiast and a creative professional, I have designed this platform to showcase my works and accomplishments in a unique and modern way.

With this website, I have combined the familiar elements of the Windows 11 operating system with my own creativity and expertise to create a dynamic and interactive portfolio website that reflects my personal brand and style.

On my website, you can explore my various projects, works, and achievements in a sleek and sophisticated environment. I have organized my portfolio into different categories, such as social handles, projects, and development, to showcase my skills and expertise.

## credits

*  **icons8**: almost all the icons in this projects have been taken from icons8 website.

* **About header**: The header for the About component was not created by me, but rather modified. The original header can be found in [Sangam Mukherjee's portfolio website](https://github.com/sangammukherjee).

<br/>

* **Skill icons**: The icons section used in the Skill component's icon section was not created by me, but rather the original code was converted from TypeScript to JavaScript by me. Unfortunately, I cannot find the link to the original code anymore.
