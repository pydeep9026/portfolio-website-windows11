<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT --> 
## About The Project

Welcome to my personal portfolio website. As a web dev enthusiast and a creative professional, I have designed this platform to showcase my works and accomplishments in a unique and modern way.

With this website, I have combined the familiar elements of the Windows 11 operating system with my own creativity and expertise to create a dynamic and interactive portfolio website that reflects my personal brand and style.

On my website, you can explore my various projects, works, and achievements in a sleek and sophisticated environment. I have organized my portfolio into different categories, such as social handles, projects, and development, to showcase my skills and expertise.
